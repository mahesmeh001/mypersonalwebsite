This is my personal website! 

I created this in the summer of 2022 because having my own website was something I always wanted.
Contrary to how personal websites are commonly used for students, I didn't want my website to be 
synonymous with my resume. I wanted this to be a place where people could find a glimpse of who I am. 

I used HTML5up to help with responsiveness (computer vs mobile) along with W3 schools's CSS sheet. 

Fun fact: If you google my name, the top results are either this website itself, or a webpage linked to this website!
