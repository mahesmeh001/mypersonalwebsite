							<p>Starting from 2020, I've been a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm
							planning on double majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics for Programing with an Honors in the Major through the
							College of Letters and Science. Here's how I've been spending my time:</p>

									provides organized badminton play, camaraderie, coaching, and tournaments for UW-Madison students, faculty and staff. </blockquote></a>
								<p>Badminton has slowly been turning into my main sport. Through the club I played in a variety of different tournaments. I even placed
									at the Steve Radar Memorial Open in 2022.</p>

								<a href="https://www.instagram.com/aasumadison/?hl=en"><blockquote style="border-left-color: black">We
									strive for traditional dance, while at the same time, incorporating modern gimmicks and Western influences,
									especially hip hop. Ever since 2006, we have become one of the premier dance groups on
									campus and in Wisconsin. We have performed at many cultural shows and in competitions
									both on and off campus. In the future, we hope to not only spread the love of Bhangra
									in Wisconsin but also to the rest of the world through performing and competing. </blockquote></a>
								<p>After joining Surma I found out that Bhangra was my favorite form of dance.
									To further pursue this passion, I tried out for WSB team and have been on it ever since.</p>

								<p>A social club for Asian Americans. I joined with Henry and had a lot of fun the first year I was in it.
								The next year I joined as a Family Leader, which was a learning experience. I plan to continue commitment to the club as a family member.</p>

									that can change the world.</blockquote></a>
								<p> I participated in Transcend to dip my toe into the world of entrepreneurship.
									Alongside Manisha and Harsh, I presented a new Flashcard alternative to Quizlet, which targeted different
									learning styles.</p>

									co-ed Bollywood Fusion dance team at UW Madison. We compete nationally in a series of competitions
									alongside some of the best schools and teams in the country.</blockquote></a>
								<p>I wanted to find new ways to express my passion for music, so I tried out for Surma to learn how to dance, and made it.
								Unfortunately the entire season was during the COVID Pandemic, which made it a very limited experience.</p>

								<p><b>First Year Committee: </b>I'd never tried any planning committee-esk organization before, so I joined the First
									Year Committee in the ISA to get an insight into what a planning committee does.</p>
								<p>After that, I became a regular member of the club.</p>
