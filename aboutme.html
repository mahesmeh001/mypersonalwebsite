            <div class="collapsiblecontent">
                <p>I spent three years involved in Business Professional of America, and became a club captain in my
                    second year.</p>
                <p>BPA was a series of tournaments, at the regional, state, and national levels. In order to compete
                    at the next level, you had to place high enough in the prior one. I made it to nationals
                    two of the three years in which I was involved.</p>

                <p>
                    Soccer used to be my main sport, and I played for about ten years. I started out at the worst division of competitive play,
                    and slowly made my way to the premier division of competitive soccer. When college came soccer departed
                    from my list of priorities, however it will always have a spot in my heart.

            <div class="collapsiblecontent" id="orch">
                <p>I spent seven years playing the viola in an orchestra. Although we primarily played in school settings,
                    we occasionally travelled, playing in Chicago and various churches across the midwest. When high school
                    ended I no longer had an orchestra to play music with, so I discontinued playing the viola. However,
                    the feeling of making music had already taken its hold on me. I turned to the guitar as a new sustainable outlet
                    for my musicality, and started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvmx1VeVALWVN1GQ9HvuEg">Youtube channel</a> on which I post guitar videos till this day.

                <p>
                    Hindu Mandir Summer Camp was an amazing opportunity for both younger and older kids to learn more
                    about their cultural background
                    by participating in a week long camp, every eyar. Unfortunately I was only involved at the HMSC for
                    two years, but it left
                    me with memories I'll never forget.
