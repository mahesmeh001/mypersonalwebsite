                                    while revisiting his wartorn homeland. Hosseini does not pull any of his

                                    It’s nice to see the story everyone knows being told from a completely different perspective.
                                    Patroclus is a nobody walking in the land of myth, which is what makes his story so interesting
                                    and unique. Although the exposition and rising action are not bad, what really sets this book
                                    aside from the rest–at least for me–was the conclusion. Not rushed yet not dragging out, in
                                    alignment with the principles of the story, I don’t think I’ve read a single book that gives
                                    you a more satisfying and complete end feeling. </p>

                            <p>Killing himself shortly after publishing this novel, No Longer Human is a heavily autobiographical
                                story about a man who does not fit in. It’s not that he’s disliked, or marginalized which alienates
                                him, but his own fear of not meeting the requirements to be considered a human being. To completely
                                understand everything in this book, you’d have to be at least as insane as the author; that being
                                said, this book has a wealth of critical analysis of society and constantly challenges your
                                ideologies about life. I love a book that makes you think, but don’t expect to walk out of
                                reading this book with a smile.</p>

                    <p>I thought this was an interesting idea because once you dive past the threshold of what is
                        and isn’t accepted by society and focus more on what you think intrapersonally, the answer
                        to this question can help you make sense of what drives you (and/or another). For example,
                        most people at first glance would respond to this question with something such as “the law”,
                        however, a more intrapersonal answer could be “selflessness” or “integrity”. Simply answering
                        in such a sense reveals a surprising much. </p>

                    <p>It would seem norms are the way they are because our societies deem them to be so. Osamu
                        challenges this conception by questioning what a society really is. ’Society’ is not a tangible thing.
                        ‘Society’ is not capable of doing. It is individuals within a society who choose to act in certain ways.
                        It may feel to an individual that everyone is doing or acting in some way, and so ‘society’
                        pressures one to conform, but this ideologue does not adequately address the reality that
                        every individual must choose to act before actually doing so. In questioning what society really is,
                        Osamu redirects attention and—by consequence of doing so—power, to the individual. </p>

                                is a recollection of painful memories in order to make something more. This book features some
                                of the most stunning prose I have ever read, especially in the beginning few chapters of the book. As the stories goes on,
                                we get more and more fractured pieces of memory, as if mimicking his fractured upbringing. In contrast to the beginning of this book
                                I felt that the ending pieces of this book were very hard to make sense of. That being said,
                                the ending pieces did not contradict the underlying messages of the book, which is why end overall conclusion was still well-developed and articulated.</p>

                                <p>Miranda takes an intensive look at the pre-pregnancy model formulated by the CDC in
                                    2006. She discusses the reasons for activists' backlash against the model, why many
                                    saw it as a transgression against the reproductive justice framework, why the CDC
                                    experts framed the model as they did, the political and historical climate of the time,
                                    and the intended effects of the model. This is an excellent book to deepen your understanding
                                    of buzzword topics in the modern political climate such as abortion, women's rights,
                                    and pregnancy care. This book also does a good job explaining both sides of the pre-pregnancy
                                    model, which is the topic of contention.

                    <h3>Interview with the author: </h3><p>After reading this book, I had the opportunity to talk directly with the author,
                    <a  href="https://coss.fsu.edu/sociology/faculty/miranda-waggoner/">Miranda R. Waggoner</a>. After talking
                    to her, I deepened my understanding of the current political climate with specific regards to women's rights and abortion.
                    Here are some of my takeaways from our conversation:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is an underwhelming amount of scientific research on the pregnant body. There are many
                            repercussion to this, but one example of how this is relevant is that for the COVID vaccine, doctors were unsure what effect
                            it would have on the baby and on the pregnant body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The message about pregnancy care and mortality is very individually focused right now (get
                            healthy, be aware that your pregnancy could be compromised). Small changes focused on the individual
                            do not have the power to solve the population's problem (within the USA), which is one of the highest infantile morality rates
                            in developed countries. Instead of this, the message should be more population focused. For example, instead of telling pregnant people
                            to not eat fish because they have mercury, question why the fish have mercury in the first place.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                                    This is a series of short stories which deal with feeling exiled and wanting to feel at home.
                                    Featuring great prose filled with literary techniques, Camus’s metaphorical stories
                                    left me empathizing with the characters. Although there are a couple of stories that
                                    went over my head, for the most part, this book was really engaging. Each story felt
                                    exactly the right length, never too rushed, and I never felt like I was being flooded
                                    with information that was hard to piece together. However, even in such small pieces
                                    of text, Camus managed to make me feel for each character, and the sad endings made
                                    me want to sit there for a few additional moments to soak everything in.

                            Even though Overlord is another overpowered main character Isekai, this story distinguishes itself by having exceptional character development.
                            Even though the outcome of every standoff was a foregone conclusion, the detailed feelings and thoughts of the characters make each encounter interesting. As our understanding of each character and the world they've been transported too increases, the depth of the novel and investment in their future grows proportionally.
                            Aside from that, the Overlord Light Novels are very well translated, something which cannot be taken for granted, and reads like the Percy Jackson or Inheritance Series.</p>

                            <p>Starting as the World's weakest, Solo Leveling is an underdog story which makes you root
                                for the main character as he faces off against death time and time again. For me, the hook
                                and beginning of this book we're the most engaging parts of the manga. As time went on I
                                started to lose interest, and I felt that the deepening of the plot was not enough to revamp
                                the same excitement the beginning of the story made me feel. That being said, the art and battles were
                            filled with really cool moments, so I still enjoyed the journey till the end. </p>
