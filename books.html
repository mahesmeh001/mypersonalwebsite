                                    When I look at this novel as a series of short stories, it is masterful. Each
                                    chapter dives into a new character’s life, and through the story, we are introduced
                                    to new ideas and perspectives on relationships, cleverly juxtaposing those
                                    introduced in the chapters before. You won’t find a one-dimensional character
                                    anywhere in this novel; each character is complex and undergoes growth and change.
                                    Whereas other books have points that they try to convey, this book is a much more
                                    open exploration, not making comments about what is 'right' or 'wrong,' but laying
                                    both the good and bad out there for the reader to decide what to make of it. When
                                    you look at it this way, it's hard to see how the book could be better.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, this is not a series of short stories; it is a novel. Although there is a
                            central plot line that motivates each of the chapters, they feel largely disconnected. Most
                            chapters end on a cliffhanger that makes you want to know what happens next, only for the
                            next chapter to completely remove you from the story and jump to a new time, place, and
                            person. Every now and then, this would be manageable, but this is the case for the entire
                            novel and quickly becomes tiring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When taken individually, each of the chapters is an amazing story full of complexity and
                            depth, but when you place them in the full context of the book, where each is dependent on
                            the next, you can’t help but feel rather disappointed with how the novel progresses.
                        </p>

                            Rightdoing and wrongdoing are subjective, and defined by your unique life experiences. That

                            Character Exploration: Nila (spoilers)
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In a novel full of complex characters, Nila is one of the most difficult to comprehend.
                            Although there are many lessons to be learned from the way she lives her life, perhaps the
                            most important is understanding that if you don’t love yourself, you can’t expect others to
                            fill that void. This idea is demonstrated throughout the book. Her father doesn’t give her
                            the time of day, so she goes looking for love by attracting men. But they can’t satisfy her,
                            and she always moves on to the next. Eventually, she settles down, not for love, but for
                            stability, and looks for love through the covenant of maternal bonding. She extirpates a
                            family for her own gain, only to find that her taken daughter, Pari, "is not enough."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nila, ever the master of deception, paints a very compelling image of herself as someone to
                            be pitied. Throughout the novel, Nila, through her interactions with others, crafts a
                            damsel-in-distress story: she keeps looking for love, yet can never seem to find it. Classic
                            move. And it’s really, really convincing. For so long while reading the novel, I thought,
                            ‘Wow, people are a result of their environments,’ but it's really not that simple. The case
                            in point is that she <i>does</i> have people who could give her the very love she chases. Pari
                            continuously makes significant sacrifices at a young age to be there for her ‘mother,’ and
                            Nabi goes as far as to sell his brother’s daughter just to try and gain her favor. The
                            reality is that she’s not someone to be pitied. In other words, people are not solely the
                            result of their environments. If you’re looking to blame your misgivings on something other
                            than yourself, you better start looking within, lest you end up like Nila (she kills
                            herself).

                                    Once you
                                    have an underlying reason to accomplish something, setting out to do it becomes
                                    infinitely easier.

                                    I've had with others, people have told me that they felt like they should act in a
                                    certain way, yet chose not to.
                                    In those conversations I thought back to this idea. One should strive to, not only
                                    recognize what they should do, but act on it as well.
                                    Only then can you say you are both externally and internally being true to yourself.

                                <li>Ignorance is a double-edged sword. Sure, sometimes ignorance eases the burden in the
                                    short term, but it always bites back.
                                    If you know that it'll harm you down the line, should you ever choose to remain
                                    ignorant about something?

                                <p><i>Circe</i>, by Miller, is the tale of the evil witch from her perspective. All
                                    sides have
                                    two stories, but this novel is about expanding your perspective. This book touches
                                    on patriarchy, misogyny, heroism, divinity, and more, both indirectly and directly
                                    challenging all kinds of social institutions. Although there are parts of the story
                                    that are harder to get through, for the most part, the book is exciting and
                                    concludes
                                    in an open-ended fashion leaving the reader to write their own ending.

                        When unsure about one's intentions, ask yourself why someone is doing what they are doing, and
                        when you have an answer, think about whether that makes sense. You can almost guarantee that
                        there
                        is more than what meets the eye if it doesn't.

                                What really sparked my interest in this book was that I heard it was used in a legal battle to convict the author, Oscar Wilde. Of what–I purposely avoided knowing until I had finished the book. However, after finishing the book and learning it was used to convict him of gay, I was quite disappointed! In the face of the kinds of depravity we see in the novel–real abominations of character within our characters–being gay seems like such a vanilla conviction. A conviction without conviction, if you will.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <p>
                        It's a really interesting book, but it definitely has some issues. For example, the development of Dorian is the driving force for the novel. He starts out as a clean slate and seems fated to grow corrupt, yet unfortunately he's not even the most interesting character! Completely outshadowed, Lord Henry has some of the most incredible dialogues I've ever read–almost nothing he says seems agreeable, but it really does provide the food for thought, and what is a good character if not stimulating? Even the artist, Basil, with his minimal screen time, had actual takes on life that were more interesting and believable than Dorian's perceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it's not really Dorian's thoughts that kept me interested. As time goes on we see his descent into madness, and how he repels and attracts others.* This creates a really good mechanism for exploring themes of self vs self and self vs society. And it's this exploration in which the book really shines. To me, the standout themes were beauty as innocence vs beauty as experience, the duality of self (private vs public), corruption and how it snowballs, and self-perception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, the book was pretty interesting, and gave lots of room for interpretation which I really liked, but was plagued by moments that drag. Until hitting the plot twist which is close to the middle of the book, it's hard to get really invested in Dorian and the story.

                        *Chapter 11 seems designed to highlight his insanity, but at the same time I felt it was doing a bit too much. It may be the most horrendous amalgamation of prolixity and sesquipedalian loquaciousness that has ever afflicted a piece of paper. I feel that the point could have been conveyed a little bit better. Do we really care about his eclectic rug collection? Not really.

                        The idea behind this quote is that how you affect other people matters more to them than how you carry yourself, or your character. Or in other words, manners over morals. It's certainaly not a pleasant thought, but does provide food for thought (pun intended).

                                Well... I tried—twice, years apart—to finish this novel. Unfortunately, the it is quite difficult to read and even harder to enjoy. The prose is stuffy, the characters constantly shift, and the story splinters into too many little tidbits that never resolve. Eventually, I found the worst part about reading the book was simply reading the book.

                    Allow me to illustrate my issue with this novel. Here are a few sentences from the story, two of which I've randomly selected and one which is supposed to highlight a character's insanity:

                <blockquote style="border-left-color: #046e7e">

                <p>
                    The issue is that the "normal" sentences are already so inflated, that the insanity illustration doesn't even register as particularly unhinged.

                <p>
                    There's a simple principle of contrast that this novel completely misses. To have meaningful lows, you need to have meaningful highs. Every third sentence – whether about trees, sunsets, or bones – is pitched at the same fervor. Every page strains for profundity, and because of that the prose exhausts rather than moves.

                                understand everything in this book, you’d have to be at least as insane as the author;

                                ideologies about life. I love a book that makes you think, but don’t expect to walk out

                    <p>I thought this was an interesting idea because once you dive past the threshold of what is

                        to this question can help you make sense of what drives you (and/or another). For example,
                        most people at first glance would respond to this question with something such as “the law”,
                        however, a more intrapersonal answer could be “selflessness” or “integrity”. Simply answering
                        in such a sense reveals a surprising much about ones self identity. </p>

                    <p>It would seem norms are the way they are because our societies deem them to be so. Osamu
                        challenges this conception by questioning what a society really is. ’Society’ is not a tangible
                        thing.
                        ‘Society’ is not capable of doing. It is individuals within a society who choose to act in
                        certain ways.
                        It may feel to an individual that everyone is doing or acting in some way, and so ‘society’
                        pressures one to conform, but this ideologue does not adequately address the reality that
                        every individual must choose to act before actually doing so. In questioning what society really
                        is,
                        Osamu redirects attention and—by consequence of doing so—power, to the individual. </p>

                                    put on a front about who you are, the more you lose yourself. Sure, sometimes being

                                    empathy and selfishness.
                                    I used to thing of them as kind of contrasting, but this book made me seriously
                                    re-evaluate that. I don't know if it's
                                    necessarily a direct relationship between the two, but I know they're not as
                                    different as they might seem.

                                    is a recollection of painful memories, pieced together to make something more. This
                                    book
                                    features some
                                    of the most stunning prose I have ever read, especially in the beginning few
                                    chapters of the book. As the stories goes on,
                                    we get more and more fractured pieces of memory, as if mimicking his fractured
                                    upbringing. Clearly crafted with intention, this book feels like an art piece.</p>

                                    In contrast to the beginning of this book I felt that the ending segments of this
                                    book were very hard to make sense of. I found the spike in difficulty of
                                    understanding to
                                    be quite detrimental to my overall experience. That
                                    being said, the ending pieces did not contradict the underlying messages of the
                                    book, allowing the conclusion to still feel well-developed.

                                    Norwegian wood follows the story of Toru as he struggles with his love for Naoko who
                                    is the girlfriend of his deceased best friend. With such a crazy driving force, I
                                    was left feeling underwhelmed throughout the majority of the story. But the rating
                                    for this novel is not that simple.
                                </p>

                                    <b>1) Our main character: Toru</b> <br>
                                    Toru lives a life many people would consider action packed—he has sex, goes
                                    traveling, meets new people, drinks, parties, the whole 9 yards. For a character
                                    that happens upon so many experiences, I found him an incredibly stagnant guy. For
                                    90% of the novel, there is 0% character development for our MC which is quite
                                    unfortunate. The main character being unable to move forward is likely stylistically
                                    done, but its consequences cascade into our plot.

                                There’s a bunch of interesting small events that happen throughout the novel. The
                                author paints vivid, memorable pictures almost every single chapter describing
                                beautiful and twisted moments. However, at the end of the each chapter, it feels
                                like we’re exactly where we started in terms of plot line. The same central issues
                                persist primarily because they’re outside of the MCs hands. The MCs inability to
                                move forward keeps these issues as the central driving force of the plot, which
                                means the plot goes basically nowhere for a large majority of the novel.
                            </p>

                                <b>3) Supporting Characters</b> <br>
                                So far it sounds like I hate this novel, but like I said, it’s complicated. The
                                character development is stylistically stuck for our central figures, but the
                                supporting characters themselves go far beyond all expectations. They’re amazing.
                                Each supporting character is their own world of mystery and intrigue, and with each
                                small event we learn a new piece of the puzzle. They are unique, eccentric, oddly
                                relatable and yet altogether foreign. Slowly building up their motivations and
                                piecing together what makes them tik was by far the most enjoyable part of the novel
                                for me. Whereas the plot struggled to give me meaning, observing the characters and
                                their interactions helped me make sense of things.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's complicated. Toru is maybe the most infuriating MC I’ve
                                ever read, but the supporting characters bring unparalleled diversity and flavor.
                                You just don’t see characters like them every day. The novel feels modern. It’s not
                                afraid to dive into difficult topics and make you feel uncomfortable.
                                It doesn't pretend the world is all roses, yet somehow leaves me finding wildfires
                                romantic.
                            </p>

                                In conclusion: 7.5/10. Fantastic if you can get past the plot not going
                                anywhere.

                                    Set in a dystopian future where firefighters burn books instead of putting out
                                    fires.
                                    Fahrenheit 451 is a classic novel which touches upon important human emotions and
                                    themes. A big part of the book
                                    has to do with ignorance, whether it be active or not, and I've found that the
                                    messages of
                                    the story are applicable to daily life. Sometimes the amount of detail the author
                                    goes into seems a tad too much,
                                    but overall the plot is very interesting, and you really feel an emotional
                                    connection with the main character.

                                    A society which defines the meaning of totalitarianism. Amidst this society, 1984 is
                                    the story
                                    of an individuals revolt. Even though the writing style was intentionally bleak to
                                    mimic daily life,
                                    I found that it took some effort to keep going, at least at the beginning through
                                    the exposition.
                                    That being said, once the rising action started, the book maintained my interest

                                    The Feed is an advanced form of intranet combined with every social media
                                    imaginable, packaged into a chip implanted in the brain. Sounds cool at first, but
                                    then
                                    come the implications.
                                    This sci-fi novel seems like something which might actually happen in our near
                                    future, and has to do
                                    a lot with consumerism, modernization, and deeper human connection. The plot of this
                                    book was very creative yet
                                    realistic, it created a future I could imagine ourselves being in. The writing style
                                    shadowed
                                    the rapid pace of the feed: information coming at you very fast, and in very
                                    digestible ways.
                                    For the most part I enjoyed reading the book, but the main character continuously
                                    pissed me off. I also had qualms with the writing; even though it is done
                                    stylistically, I found
                                    the train of thought sentencing rather annoying.

                                    Rick is a bounty hunter whose job is to kill Androids. Seem simple? It's everything
                                    but.
                                    Unsurprisingly, this book has a lot to do with the issues of self identity and
                                    morality,
                                    asking questions like <i>Who are androids and why are they different than
                                    humans?</i> and <i>What makes humans Human?</i>
                                    Even though I read this book in 2012, I remember it left strong impression on me.
                                    That being said, I can't remember the morals of the story, or
                                    even how the book ended, both of which I can do with many books that leave a strong
                                    impression on me. Even though my approach to reading a book has become much more
                                    through as of late, I still find it hard to give a higher rating with these
                                    factors in mind.

                                variety of brown experiences, leaving us with open endings to draw our
                                own conclusions. Written by a desi author for a desi audience, these stories
                                finally provide us with an authentic portrait of the brown experience. </p>

                                    Featuring great prose filled with literary techniques, Camus’s metaphorical stories
                                    left me empathizing with the characters. Although there are a couple of stories that
                                    went over my head, for the most part, this book was really engaging. Each story felt
                                    exactly the right length, never too rushed, and I never felt like I was being
                                    flooded
                                    with information that was hard to piece together. However, even in such small pieces
                                    of text, Camus managed to make me feel for each character, and the sad endings made
                                    me want to sit there for a few additional moments to soak everything in.

                                The third Madeline Miller work I've read, <i>Galatea</i> is a short story about a statue
                                come
                                to life. Historically documented as a tale of divine blessing and unbridled love, Miller
                                reimagines
                                the story in a darker, down-to-earth rendition. Although there were outlets for
                                creative interpretation, such as why Galatea is never explicitly called by name, I
                                found the story bland and hidden behind the shadow of her prior successes "Circe" and
                                "Song of Achilles".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So far I've found that the most compelling short stories allow readers to ponder a wide
                                variety of
                                moral questions, which is why I thought that this story was too straightforward.
                                Although it certainly detailed misogyny and it's implications (and did so in an
                                intriguing manner),
                                I would have appreciated a deeper commentary, perhaps about the underlying power systems
                                as she had in the past,
                                allowing for more personal connections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another problem I had was developing an emotional connection with Galatea’s child. Even
                                though a deeper understanding of the child is not necessary for the plot to progress, in
                                Miller's prior work she was able to add color to the story by creating dimensional
                                characters.
                                In contrast, Galatea’s child seemed very 2D which was especially prevalent considering
                                how few characters there are.
                                That being said, the ending of the story was very satisfying and complete, which is a
                                trait seen time and time again in her stories.

                                <p>Miranda takes an intensive look at the pre-pregnancy model formulated by the CDC in
                                    2006. She discusses the reasons for activists' backlash against the model, why many
                                    saw it as a transgression against the reproductive justice framework, why the CDC
                                    experts framed the model as they did, the political and historical climate of the
                                    time,
                                    and the intended effects of the model. This is an excellent book to deepen your

                                    of buzzword topics in the modern political climate such as abortion, women's rights,
                                    and pregnancy care. This book also does a good job explaining both sides of the
                                    pre-pregnancy
                                    model, which is the topic of contention.

                    <h3>Interview with the author: </h3>
                    <p>After reading this book, I had the opportunity to talk directly with the author,
                        <a href="https://coss.fsu.edu/sociology/faculty/miranda-waggoner/">Miranda R. Waggoner</a>.
                        After talking
                        to her, I deepened my understanding of the current political climate with specific regards to
                        women's rights and abortion.
                        Here are some of my takeaways from our conversation:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is an underwhelming amount of scientific research on the pregnant body. There are many
                            repercussion to this, but one example of how this is relevant is that for the COVID vaccine,
                            doctors were unsure what effect
                            it would have on the baby and on the pregnant body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The message about pregnancy care and mortality is very individually focused right now (get
                            healthy, be aware that your pregnancy could be compromised). Small changes focused on the
                            individual
                            do not have the power to solve the population's problem (within the USA), which is one of
                            the highest infantile morality rates
                            in developed countries. Instead of this, the message should be more population focused. For
                            example, instead of telling pregnant people
                            to not eat fish because they have mercury, question why the fish have mercury in the first
                            place.

                                    This book argues that the division of labor regarding contraception is not
                                    equitable,
                                    and that women are socialized into using female brith control methods. For example,
                                    Littlejohn argues that
                                    thinking along the lines of condoms are the responsibility of men and birth control

                                    Reservation.
                                    It takes an in depth look on pregnancy, childbirth, and how colonialism contrasted
                                    and affected
                                    the policies and practices on the reservation.

                                    Shuster dives into the long and complicated history of trans medicine and how the
                                    modern
                                    conceptions carried through the medical field may negatively impact trans patients.
                                    Topics
                                    discussed in this book include questions about credibility of trans patients, the
                                    lack of medical knowledge with trans patients,
                                    and how the history of trans medicine effects doctors in the current day and age.
