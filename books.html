                                    while revisiting his wartorn homeland. Hosseini does not pull any of his

                                    simultaneously enthralling and horrifying you while depicting harsh truths.

                        <p>A modern rendition of the age-old story of Achilles told through the eyes of his lover, Patroclus.
                            It’s nice to see the story everyone knows being told from a completely different perspective.
                            Patroclus is a nobody walking in the land of myth, which is what makes his story so interesting
                            and unique. Although the exposition and rising action are not bad, what really sets this book
                            aside from the rest–at least for me–was the conclusion. Not rushed yet not dragging out, in
                            alignment with the principles of the story, I don’t think I’ve read a single book that gives
                            you a more satisfying and complete end feeling. </p>

                            <p>Killing himself shortly after publishing this novel, No Longer Human is a heavily autobiographical
                                story about a man who does not fit in. It’s not that he’s disliked, or marginalized which alienates
                                him, but his own fear of not meeting the requirements to be considered a human being. To completely
                                understand everything in this book, you’d have to be at least as insane as the author; that being
                                said, this book has a wealth of critical analysis of society and constantly challenges your
                                ideologies about life. I love a book that makes you think, but don’t expect to walk out of
                                reading this book with a smile.</p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I thought this was an interesting idea because once you dive past the threshold of what is
                        and isn’t accepted by society and focus more on what you think intrapersonally, the answer
                        to this question can help you make sense of what drives you (and/or another). For example,
                        most people at first glance would respond to this question with something such as “the law”,
                        however, a more intrapersonal answer could be “selflessness” or “integrity”. Simply answering
                        in such a sense reveals a surprising much. </p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>It would seem norms are the way they are because our societies deem them to be so. Osamu
                        challenges this conception by questioning what a society really is. ’Society’ is not a tangible thing.
                        ‘Society’ is not capable of doing. It is individuals within a society who choose to act in certain ways.
                        It may feel to an individual that everyone is doing or acting in some way, and so ‘society’
                        pressures one to conform, but this ideologue does not adequately address the reality that
                        every individual must choose to act before actually doing so. In questioning what society really is,
                        Osamu redirects attention and—by consequence of doing so—power, to the individual. </p>
