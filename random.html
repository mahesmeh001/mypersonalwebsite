        <!--Post: MN Open 2024 website-->
        <div style="border-color: #262626" id="mn open">

            <h2 class="w3-center">MN Open 2024</h2>
            <p>
                I competed at the MN Open. This time around I only participated in singles games, and actually did much
                better
                than I thought I would. Sadly the last game I played I approached with the competely wrong mentality. I
                realized my
                opponent was of quality, and thought I had already come much further than I thought I would
                (quarter-finals) and
                mentally gave up even before I started.
            </p>
            <p>
                Facing a skilled player with that mentality is a death wish, and I got badly beat in the first set. I
                realized that I had made a mental concession and was playing much worse than I was capable of, and
                decided not to give up easily. The second set was 18-21, my loss, ending the game. Had I started proactively competing right away with
                the first set, I may have been able to go much further. Ultimately it was a horrible loss for me because I felt
                like I robbed myself, and for no good reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were a lot of upsides to the tournament, however. I realized that not only can I played with skilled players,
                I can beat them too. Most of the skilled players I go against are technically stronger than me, which means
                I have to control the pace of the game by constantly <i>thinking</i>. Where is the worst spot to hit the bird for them,
                what can I do to get them off their rhythm, how quickly am I draining my stamina, and why am I dropping points.
                Footwork is everything, 90% of the time footwork is the answer to the problem in badminton.
                Play every single point with intention, and make sure you don't get into the pitfall of dropping many points in a row.

        <!--Post: Painting-->
        <div style="border-color: #262626" id="painting">

            <h2 class="w3-center">Painting</h2>
            <p>
                Over the summer (2024) I got super into painting. After reading "The Pocket" by Thich Nhat Hanh, I started
                thinking a lot about rooting myself in the present, and romanticizing life. Partly due to a renewed sense of
                wordly wonder, and partly due to a fear of losing my eyesight from being a CS major, I started staring at nature
                with more intensity. I realized there is so much beauty in each moment that goes by, and if done intentionally, even
                something as simple as staring at a shallow beach can be quite deep.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not chasing photo-realism with my paintings. I want to use painting as a tool to portray the world
                and my experiences through my own 'lens'. Photography often falls short of how I experience things, it's lacking that personal touch.
                I hope that by painting my experiences, I can think more deeply about them, and how they made me feel, and reflect that
                onto the canvas. It's quite the lofty aspiration, but I'll start one stroke at a time.
            </p>

            <p>
                I created a webpage for Madtown Bhangra club! Up till 2023, Madtown Bhangra had been an online
                competition. We
                wanted to bring the competition in person for the first time ever, but in order to do so we had
                to fundraise
                15 thousand dollars in less than 6 months. To achieve this goal, I created a website for Madtown Bhangra
                to get sponsorship.
                The website actually did its job, it attracted sponsors and got us to our goal. Check out the website

            <p>
                Everything is bigger in Texas and the bhangra competitions are no different. By far the most
                exhilarating and
                intimidating performance I have ever given, Bhangra at the Alamo pitched us, WSB, against some of the
                best teams--not
                only from the USA but also our neighbors up north. We definitely should not have been there, but it was
                an opportunity
                unlike any other. Seeing these teams perform shattered my impressions of what constitutes "good dance",
                and inspired me to get
                much more into bhangra.

            <p>
                I competed at the Pioneer Open in Illinois. When it comes to badminton, Illinois is the most competitive
                state in the midwest,
                hosting multiple different badminton academies, and the allure of Chicago
                bringing players from abroad. With that in mind, it was nothing less than a complete shock when I not
                only won games,
                but got <em>first place</em> in the lower flight at the open for Mens Doubles. While here I got to see
                some seriously
                amazing players strut their stuff.

                I performed with the Wisconsin School of Bhangra at UW-Madison's Bollywood Fusion Dance competition. At
                this point of the year, this was
                one of the larger venues I had performed at, making the preparation and experience unique in its own
                right. This
                event was recorded by <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzilQs_wTrZRUdl7weE4VyQ">@ASHWINXSURESH</a> , a channel which
                has been especially prominent with the DDN circuit.

                I performed in India Night with the Bhangra team! We got to be the closing act, and it was a very
                exciting experience.
                Just like the last big event, I had a lot of friends who performed in a variety of different ways,
                whether it be dancing,
                singing, or playing an instrument. All in all it was definitely a night to remember.

            <h2 class="w3-center">Madison Open 2022</h2>
            <p>
                I competed in the Madison Open to put my badminton skills to the test. Unfortunately, I lost almost
                every game I
                played, but in all fairness, this year I got seriously unlucky. I had to compete against
                <a href="https://www.shannonpohl.com/introducing-spbas-new-high-performance-coach/">Jimmy Pohan</a>
                who was formerly the #1 player in the United States! The craziest thing is, he didn't even win the
                singles competition,
                which serves to show how competitive the tournament was this year. Even though I got destroyed this
                year, I got a lot of valuable experience,
                so hopefully future competitions end better for me.

            <p>
                I created a webpage for badminton club! Following my election as the communications and social media
                chair at the club,
                I decided there needed to be a better way of centralizing information for new and current members.
                Luckily, over
                the summer I created my personal website, and now had the ability to create websites on demand.
                Utilizing what I learned, I created
                a brand-new website for the badminton club. Check it out <a

                get it up to performance level. Luckily, I didn't have anything else pressing on my schedule making it a

                A lot of my friends performed as well, through RangDe, Surma, Waale, and Fuego.

                    I went to go see Mani's Arangatram! An Arangetram is the graduation in a Bharatanatyam dancers
                    career. For her, this was the
                    hard work and dedication of 15 years of dancing all put into one presentation. The production
                    included over
                    three hours of memorized choreography, musical interludes with improvisation, various speeches, and
                    great food!

            <p>
                Recently, through Pooja Bartake and Hrishi Shah, I got the opportunity to participate in creating a
                music video.
                Although this wasn't my first time acting in a small film, it was an entirely new experience, and I had
                a lot of fun
                filming with my co-star, Ruhee.

            <h2 class="w3-center">Steve Radar Badminton Tournament</h2>
            <p>
                I'd been playing for about two years and slowly but steadily improving all the while. I heard about the
                Steve Radar
                Memorial Badminton tournament, and decided it was time to put my skills to the test.
                In the tournament I got second place with Henry in mens doubles in the D bracket. I also played singles
                and lost the majority
                of the games I played. The tournament was both humbling and rewarding; it showed me that I'm still far
                away from the
                level of play I wanted to be at, yet showed me that the effort I had been putting towards getting better
                was not for nought.
